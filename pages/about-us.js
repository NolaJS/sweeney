                Sweeney Restoration was established in the wake of hurricane Katrina to provide
                quality renovations and reliable service to the New Orleans community. In the midst
                of regional rejuvenation and restoration, Devon Sweeney found inspiration and
                established Sweeney Restoration. His goal was to provide excellent construction
                services to his clients. Since then, Sweeney Restoration has grown to become a
                full-service general contracting business providing custom remodeling and new
                construction.
